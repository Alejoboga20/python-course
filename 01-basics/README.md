# Python Basics 101

## Data Types

Python includes the following `fundamental` data types:

- `int` (integer)
- `float` (floating-point number)
- `str` (string)
- `bool` (boolean)
- `list` (list)
- `tuple` (tuple)
- `dict` (dictionary)
- `set` (set)

information is stored in variables. Variables are containers for storing data values using data types.

We also have Classes in python to represnt `custom` types.

```python
class MyClass:
  x = 5
```

Finally we have specialized data types that are not built-in but are part of other python's modules. For example, `datetime` module provides `date` and `time` data types.

We also have `None` data type which is used to represent the absence of a value.
